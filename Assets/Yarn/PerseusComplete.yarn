Perseus: You-! You can restore Constellations!

Sylvie: I can? OH! I CAN!

Perseus: Fascinating... I've never heard of a constellation with such power. Who are you?

Sylvie: Me? I'm Sylvie... I think.

Perseus: Interesting. Your power can do some much needed help here.

Perseus: Tell you what. Go visit Lyra over in the Lovers Nebula. She might be able to help you.

Perseus: (It's too dangerous. But their power... Maybe it is possible...)
